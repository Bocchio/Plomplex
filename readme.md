Domain coloring plotter for complex functions

---

Installing
----------

This is the source repository for [the online app][1]. The online app only
requires Chrome 21 to run. To run the server yourself, you'll need Node.js and
some packages, installable via npm using the following package names:

 - `express`
 - `jade`
 - `less`
 - `less-middleware`
 - `merge-js`

Overview
--------

The main app is a HTML file generated by Jade. For CSS, LESS is used. The
actual calculation and plotting happens in a Web Worker.

 - `js`: Client JavaScript files for the app
 - `js/worker`: Complex number implementation, parser, plotter
 - `css`: CSS files
 - `views`: Jade files
 - `views/help`: The help articles of the app
 - `json`: JSON files used to feed Jade (tooltips/example functions)
 - `server.js`: The server start file

The app relies upon jQuery. Some home-made plugins have been used:

 - `jquery.persistForm`: This plugin saves the form data (formula entered, etc)
   and loads it next time you open the app
 - `jquery.xVal`: This plugin is like `.val` but has enhanced return values,
   such as returning a number value for `<input type="number">` elements.
